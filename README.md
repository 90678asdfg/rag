# RAG
This project implements a RAG system to perform document-based question answering on a collection of 10 PDF files covering different topics. The system leverages Streamlit for an interactive interface and utilizes Ollama LangChain to power its document retrieval and language model capabilities.

FEATURES
Efficient document ingestion and processing of PDF files,
Interactive user interface built with Streamlit,
Uses advanced language models via Ollama LangChain for question answering,
Retrieves relevant passages from the PDFs to support the answers,
Supports diverse topics across multiple PDFs.


HOW IT WORKS
Input the PDF files into the system.
Ask a question related to the content of the PDFs through the Streamlit interface.
The system searches through the documents, extracts relevant information using LangChain, and generates an answer with supporting evidence from the text.
