# rag
This project implements a RAG system to perform document-based question answering on a collection of 10 PDF files covering different topics. The system allows users to input natural language questions and retrieve accurate answers, with references from the source PDFs.

Features
Efficient document ingestion and processing of PDF files
Uses advanced language models to understand and answer questions
Retrieves relevant passages from the PDFs to support the answers
Supports diverse topics across multiple PDFs
How it Works
Input the PDF files into the system.
Ask a question related to the content of the PDFs.
The system searches through the documents, extracts relevant information, and generates an answer with supporting evidence from the text.
